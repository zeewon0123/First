# My Project Plan 

***Note :*** This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide ant working guide to an actual project.

### Proposal
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images.
In order to built it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensoFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

### Dependencies
---
+ python
+ opencv-python
+ tensorflow
+ openmmlab
+ package manager

### Installation
---
In a hash terminal, run the following commands ( _Do NOT actually run these command in your computer_ ):
